For the platform to run propperly, clone the origami-backend repository from https://github.com/ifgi-sil/origami-backend.git

Next, stop your MongoDB Service, and run the bash-script at origami-mongo/set_mongodb_password.sh within said repository.
This will set the DB Authentication Flags and PW needed to run the App.
Next, restart the MongoDB Service with "mongod --auth --port 27017 --dbpath [your desired path]".

Now, open the file  config/index.js  within the origami-backend and change the config JSON to:
var config = {
  dbhost: 'localhost:27017',
  dbuser: 'admin',
  dbuserpass: 'admin',
  port: 5000
};

Now execute npm install in the origami-backend, end start the server.js file with "node server.js".

Now, your BackEnd is all set, and you can start the OriGami3.0 FrontEnd!!
To do this, navigate to the OriGami3.0 folder, and at its root, execute the commands:

"cd server && npm install && cd ../ && bower install", and then, finally, "gulp dev".

This will automatically open a new window in your browser, but will do so too early.
Due to not all dependencies being loaded in time, the window will remain empty or contain an error message.
Be not afraid, wait for a couple of seconds (~5^ depending on your machine) and refresh the page.
You should now be able to see the OriGami3.0 homepage.

Prerequisites:  git, MongoDB v3.x.x^, gulp, node & npm, bower.
